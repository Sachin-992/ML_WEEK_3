# ML_WEEK_3
<h2>Project Summary<h2>
 <h4>This repository shows my learning and implementation of deep learning models step by step using popular image datasets like CIFAR-10, Dog Breed, and MNIST.<h4>



ðŸ”¹ Step 1: CNN with CIFAR-10
I started by learning and implementing a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand how image classification works with deep learning.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Model Comparison on CIFAR-10
After that, I created a file to compare three deep learning models on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

  1)basic CNN model

  2)CNN with Data Augmentation to improve accuracy

  3)CNN using ResNet architecture to solve the vanishing gradient problem

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Transfer Learning with Dog Breed Dataset
Once I understood CNNs and ResNet, I moved on to Transfer Learning. I used a pre-trained ResNet model to classify dog breeds in a new dataset, learning how to fine-tune existing models for custom tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: MNIST Digit Classification
Finally, I implemented a CNN model for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset to test and practice everything I learned in a simple classification task.
 
<h2>Learnings<h2>
 
 1)Learn and implement CNNs from scratch.
 
 2)Understand ResNet architecture and how it helps with vanishing gradients.
 
 3)Apply data augmentation techniques to improve validation accuracy.
 
 4)Analyze and compare model performance.
