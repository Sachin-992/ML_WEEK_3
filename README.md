<h2>CIFAR-10 Image Classification<h2>
This project contains the implementation and comparison of three deep learning models for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The focus is on understanding CNNs, exploring the ResNet architecture to overcome vanishing gradients, and testing the impact of data augmentation.
 
<h2>Learnings<h2>
 
 1)Learn and implement CNNs from scratch.
 
 2)Understand ResNet architecture and how it helps with vanishing gradients.
 
 3)Apply data augmentation techniques to improve validation accuracy.
 
 4)Analyze and compare model performance.
